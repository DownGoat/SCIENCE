Company Finance
===============

Costs and Prices
----------------

Costs are the cost to build and make a product.

Price is the cost to your customer.


Costs
-----

Purchase costs include things like raw materials and equipment.

Costs of finance includes interest on debts, etc.

Cost of labour.

Overhead costs.

You might make money from an item, but you still make a loss on that item.

Fixed and Variable costs.

Staff costs: junior staff have around 220 chargeable days, senior staff have around 160 chargeable days (260 max).

Overhead costs not attributable to a given project.


Depreciation
------------

Most things depreciate in value. You need to know the value of equipment and stock, but sometimes it's too costly to revalue each item. Although you make profits/sales due to having an item, the actual item itself depreciates and is a cost to the business.

$$ profit = sales - costs $$

When you pay tax you want to reduce the amount of money going to the tax people and they allow you to take the depreciation of all your items from your profits.

Straight line depreciation means the item depreciates the same amount each year.

Reducing balance depreciation means the item depreciates by a percentage each year.


Pricing in the Computing Industry
---------------------------------

###Cost Plus - Project Work

Agree with client your costs per day, usually on direct labour (overhead).

Agree profit margin.

"Body shopping"

Unsuitable today for projects but used to supply skills/experience to customer projects.


###Fixed Price - Project Work

Total of: direct labour, brought in items and "indirects".

Profits added onto costs.

Used in competitive tendering (the higher the risk, the higher the profit). Risks versus profits.

####How this tends to work:
Engineers are graded (normally by salary). Company will work out an average salary per grade. Add in overheads and arrive at a daily charge.

When it comes to costing up a product, number of people; at what grade times by the daily rate for the estimate of the product length to come to a total amount of labour charges.

When you have a labour cost, you add the hardware (plus a markup on this hardware), then add a contingency. This is the big problem with fixed price work. This should be as high as you can make it. Finally add profit, simmer and serve.

Sometimes pricing is about losing business, but about being seen.

Software Product Pricing
------------------------

Marginal costs very low (manual, box, CD, etc.)

Large development costs.

Amortised over time.

Sales proportional to marketing.

Sales fall with increasing price.
