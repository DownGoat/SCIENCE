You might make money from an item, but you still make a loss on that item.

Fixed and Variable costs.

Staff costs: junior staff have around 220 chargeable days, senior staff have around 160 chargeable days (260 max).

Overhead costs not attributable to a given project.


Depreciation
------------

Most things depreciate in value. You need to know the value of equipment and stock, but sometimes it's too costly to revalue each item. Although you make profits/sales due to having an item, the actual item itself depreciates and is a cost to the business.

$$ profit = sales - costs $$

When you pay tax you want to reduce the amount of money going to the tax people and they allow you to take the depreciation of all your items from your profits.

Straight line depreciation means the item depreciates the same amount each year.

Reducing balance depreciation means the item depreciates by a percentage each year.
