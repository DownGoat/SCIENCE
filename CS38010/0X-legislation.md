Legislation
===========

Talked about some law stuff.

Secondary Legislation
---------------------

An act of parliament often given the government power to introduce regulations (*statutory instruments*) that are laid before Parliament but are debated only if a member specifically calls for a debate.i

###Examples:

* Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997
* Companies (Single Person Private Limited Companies) Regulations 1992
* Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981


European Union Law
------------------

The EU issues directives, approved by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Member states are then required to enact legislation to give effect to these directives.

The European Count of Justice handles cases where the interpretation or implementation of directives is in question.

Data protection act was an EU act.


Legal Systems in Other Countries
--------------------------------

Distinction between civil and criminal law is universal. Common law largely restricted to countries that have been ruled by Britain. European countries other than the UK have a system based on Roman law.

Most large countries have bicameral legislatures, small ones usually have unicameral ones.

In some countries the second chamber has a revising function only while in others (e.g. the USA) it can also initiate legislation.

Federal states duplicate the legislative structure at the level of the individual state. There is often tension between state law and federal law.


Constitutions
-------------


Most countries (not the UK) have constitutions:

* How the country is governed
* The rights of the citizens
* ???

In countries with a written constitution there is a Supreme count which can strike out a legislation that is contrary to the constitution.

In the UK, the doctrine of the *sovereignty of Parliament*, means that if Parliament passes legislation, the courts cannot block it.
