What is Business
----------------

* "An establishment to make money."
* "Useful and incentive."
* "Providing a service."
* "Trading."
* "Producing a product."
* "Innovating to remain competitive."
* "Solving a problem."
* "Franchising."

Most businesses are in it to make money (Authors note: *well duh*).

> *"Waffle Waffle Waffle, several Shades of Grey, waffle."*

tl;dr - A business is about making money.

All businesses need customers.

Thought of as some organisation...
Organisations
=============

> *"[Inland Revenue] are a bunch of thieves."* - Rhys Parry 2013


Commercial Organisations
------------------------


* Sole Trader
    * Local Shop, Plumber, etc.
* Partnership
    * Doctors, Lawyers, Accountants
* Limited Company
    * Public and private


Sole Traders
------------

An individual who is responsible for all debts. All assets including "private" at risk; if you have debts the business can't pay then you may lose personal items (including houses, etc.).

Can register for VAT, has to register for inland revenue/social security. Income tax on profits, national in-sewer-ants.

$$Profits = Sales - Costs$$

Simplified bookkeeping.

Does **not** have to be the only employee.

Lots of risks. Lots of independence and flexibility.


Partnerships
------------

Similar to sole trader but with two or more owners.

Normally professionals.

(*Rhys mentioned stuff about Limited Liability Partnerships which might be useful for the assignment.*)


Incorporated
------------

Law recognises individuals are responsible for actions (except by your, mental incapacity or registered student), can enter into contracts and can be sued, tried for crimes, etc.

Act of parliament imposes duties on the individual.

Incorporation; making a body (*Corpus*)

Make a company look like a person (a body).

* Royal Charters
* Acts of Parliament
* Public and Private Companies


Share Capital
-------------

Shareholders (Subscribers) own the company. Managing Directors may not be shareholders. Ever limited company has to have at least one annual meeting with the shareholders.

At the start of the company you authorise the share capital (the number of shares and their nominal (par) value). You can set the company up with shares at £0.01 per share (100 shares for £1). All the shareholders lose is the initial investment; directors may be liable for bankruptcy. This stops "Phoenix Companies". A company may go bankrupt for no fault of it's own (e.g. due to recession).

In the United Kingdom, there seems to be a "looking down" on someone who has failed at a business, unlike in the USA and Germany.

Shares can be paid for (the shareholder's equity). This equity is put into the bank for the company. As a shareholder you can partly pay for these shares but if the company demands the full value of the shares you must pay it.

Preference shares are slightly different in that if you started a company. These shares take a set value of the profits before the rest of the shareholders.

When a company is "wound up" (going into liquidation, either voluntary or forced) all debts must be paid before the shareholders. All assets are sold. If there is a remainder then this remainder is divided equally between shareholders. If the debts are greater than the assets, the shareholders lose shares.

Quite often the owners buy the assets so the money goes back to the shareholders.

**Rhys' tip of the day:** if you need money go to friendly solicitor and threaten them with winding up procedures.

When a company goes public all shares are sold at a set price. The company then owns some of their own shares. Individuals will then buy shares because people want to buy shares, or because they will get some of the profit in the form of a dividend. The effect this has in the open market is that if you look at the initial price is the nominal value of the company. It's just that people are trading these shares as if they were selling tickets for an event. There's a slight difference in that most big companies will have shares in themselves so they can borrow money against their shares.

If you have a good share price, you become very attractive to banks.


Bureaucracy
-----------

Large Companies (Public Limited Company [PLC]), shares are available to the public via the stock exchange.

Small companies cannot advertise shares in the same way. Regulated by Companies Act.

(*Some table on what a micro, small and medium company is*)


Company Constitution
--------------------

When you start a company you have to go and buy it.

In the UK it is easy to start and run a limited company.

> *"I hate to say this but some of my best friends are French."* Rhys Parry, February 2013



There is a Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association and there can be Shareholders Agreement.


###Memorandum of Association

* Restrictions on company name.
* Register for a specific country.
* The objects of company (Companies Act 1989 allow general commercial company).
* A liability clause (liability of members is limited).
* Authorised Share value.


###Articles of Association

* Rules of Share capital
* Transfer of Shares
* Meetings of Members
* Rules governing directors' appointments
* Power of directors
* Dividends and reserves

Changed in a shareholders meeting.

Dividends are the money which the directors decided (under the guidance of the shareholders) which is given away to the shareholders. Reserves help take the company into the next year.


###Shareholders Agreement

* Protect interests of minor shareholders
* Article of Associated can only be changed at a general meeting and needs a 75% majority (look this up, it may have changed).
* Agreement between shareholders, all shareholders must sign and can govern the way in which voting is done.


Directors and Company Secretary
-------------------------------

Directors elected by Shareholder who act in the best interest of the company. They should be honest, declare their interest in the company and aware of the company's trading position.

Directors split into executive and non-executive directors.

Executive directors work for the company, non-executive directors paid for the knowledge of the industry.

Company Secretary produce statutory returns to the companies house. Can be any person in the company.
Company Finance
===============

Costs and Prices
----------------

Costs are the cost to build and make a product.

Price is the cost to your customer.


Costs
-----

Purchase costs include things like raw materials and equipment.

Costs of finance includes interest on debts, etc.

Cost of labour.

Overhead costs.

You might make money from an item, but you still make a loss on that item.

Fixed and Variable costs.

Staff costs: junior staff have around 220 chargeable days, senior staff have around 160 chargeable days (260 max).

Overhead costs not attributable to a given project.


Depreciation
------------

Most things depreciate in value. You need to know the value of equipment and stock, but sometimes it's too costly to revalue each item. Although you make profits/sales due to having an item, the actual item itself depreciates and is a cost to the business.

$$ profit = sales - costs $$

When you pay tax you want to reduce the amount of money going to the tax people and they allow you to take the depreciation of all your items from your profits.

Straight line depreciation means the item depreciates the same amount each year.

Reducing balance depreciation means the item depreciates by a percentage each year.


Pricing in the Computing Industry
---------------------------------

###Cost Plus - Project Work

Agree with client your costs per day, usually on direct labour (overhead).

Agree profit margin.

"Body shopping"

Unsuitable today for projects but used to supply skills/experience to customer projects.


###Fixed Price - Project Work

Total of: direct labour, brought in items and "indirects".

Profits added onto costs.

Used in competitive tendering (the higher the risk, the higher the profit). Risks versus profits.

####How this tends to work:
Engineers are graded (normally by salary). Company will work out an average salary per grade. Add in overheads and arrive at a daily charge.

When it comes to costing up a product, number of people; at what grade times by the daily rate for the estimate of the product length to come to a total amount of labour charges.

When you have a labour cost, you add the hardware (plus a markup on this hardware), then add a contingency. This is the big problem with fixed price work. This should be as high as you can make it. Finally add profit, simmer and serve.

Sometimes pricing is about losing business, but about being seen.

> *"Don't be afraid to add a markup."* Sage advice from Rhys Parry, February 2013


Software Product Pricing
------------------------

Marginal costs very low (manual, box, CD, etc.)

Large development costs.

Amortised over time.

Sales proportional to marketing.

Sales fall with increasing price.

> *"I must go on a diet"* - Rhys Parry after turning on some lights with his bulk, February 2013,


Customer Expectations
---------------------

Price		Nature
--------	------------------------------------------------
Free		Shareware
£20     	Buyers Risk - Internet Sales
£100-500	High volume - Real software - Office suits, etc.
£10,000		Real product - low volume - Bugs and Support
£1000,000	On the drawing board (or an IBM product)


Support and other Issues
------------------------

Large percentage of income (10-25% of turnover).


Cash Flow
---------

Gets confused with profits.

Bringing in a concept called *credit*. Business to business (B2B) relationships.

Most companies allow you credit. Upon invoice normally you have 30 days in credit.

Credit orders and invoices are the norm for B2B transactions.


Payment Cycle
-------------

Send invoice at the end of the Month

Receive money 1-2 months later

Therefore up to 3 months salaries, rents, bills to pay, etc.

Problem is you need cash as a start-up.

Big companies are generally the worst for paying in time.

> *"Oh it's a long walk here."* - Rhys going from one side of Hugh Owen C4 to the other.

Cash in and cash out are not the same as sales, costs and profits.


Types of Software House
-----------------------

Body Shopping Services - need a few months working capital.

Product Developer - Needs perhaps a year or more development funds.

Bespoke Software - Could use advanced from customer to help cash flow.


Getting the Money
-----------------

(*A: tl;dr "Give us your fucking money."*).

Business plan:

* Description of Business
* Technical feasibility
* Founders expertise
* Market size
* Competition
* Financial prediction

More later.


Sources of Funds
----------------

* Loans
* Equity
* Grants


###Grants

Money *given* to a company. May have restrictions on various things.


###Loans

Money *lent* to a company. Interest payable on it, personal guarantees on the loan.

Secured loan has some assurance that you have enough collateral. Unsecured they don't.

Personal loans from friends.

Soft leans, short/long term, overdraft, etc.


###Equity

Money *paid* to the company for a *share* of that company.

Risk versus reward.

Dragons Den. I'm out.


Balance Sheets
--------------

Time for motherfucking spreadsheets (in space).

Snapshot on a particular date.

How much are you worth?

* Assets, fixed and liquid (current).

How much do you owe?

* Tax
* VAT
* Creditors
* Bank Loans
* Shareholders

$$ Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders\text{ }Equity $$

###P/L Cost Overheads

* Wages
* NI
* Rent
* Rates - Business and Water
* Gas and Electricity
* Telephone, ISP
* Postage, Printing, Stationary
* Advertising
* Insurance
* Repairs and Maintenance
* Interest Payments
* Bank charges
* Depreciation
* Travel
* Legal
* Subscriptions and Periodicals

###Capital Equipment

Capital Equipment does not appear in the P/L, it is taken from the cashflow and the depreciation is treated as a cost in the P/L.


###Rhys' Tip for the Assignment (of the week)

Projected profile/loss worked out every month. Cashflow on a monthly basis. Balance sheet at the end of the year.


###Example Startup

Shareholders raise: £50,000

Cash goes in the bank.

After trading for a while:

Sales: £10,000 (invoiced)

VAT: £1,750

Purchases: £2,000

Assets               Liabilities and Shareholders
---------            ----------------------------
Receivables £11,750  ...
Cash on hand $48,000 ...
Computers £2,000     ...
Total £61,750        ...

Receivables are things that haven't been paid, but have been invoiced/similar.


Remember this shit
------------------

Try this by purchasing items on credit to create liabilities, you put how much you owe on the liabilities side and the new item into your assets (this balances).

When you pay it off you lose the liability on one side and the cash from your asset side.

Reduce the profit (shareholders equity) by the depreciate to date, balances with loss of same amount on the assets side of the equation.

Balances sheets **balance**.

Balance sheets run vertically.


Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
===================================
Ways for big corporations to get stinking rich.

Types of Rights
---------------
* Copyright
* Patents
* Confidential Information
* Trademarks
* Design Rights
* Moral Rights


Copyright
---------
Protects:

* Original works (literary, dramatic, musical and artistic).
* Sound recordings, films, broadcasts and cable transmissions.
* The typographic arrangement of published editions.

Any protected item is known as a "work".

### Software Copyright
The 1988 Copyright, Patents and Design Act states that the phrase "literary work" includes a table
or compilation, a computer program and preparatory design materials for a computer program.

An EU directive makes a similar clause.

### Copyright Holder Rights
Copyright holders get five exclusive rights:

1. The right to copy the work.
2. The right to issue copies to the public.
3. The right to perform, play or show the work to the public.
4. The right to broadcast the work or transmit it to a cable service.
5. The right to make an adaption of the work.

These rights last different lengths depending on the country - 70 years since the death of the 
author in the EU and USA (post-2002 for the latter). Pre-2002 USA copyright can last up to 95 
years in some cases.

50 years since the death of the author in Canada.

### Database Rights

If a database is the author's "own original intellectual creation", it is treated as a literary
work. If there has been "substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents
of the database", then it is also protected by the database right (which lasts 15 years less than
full copyright).

### Who Owns Copyright?
Copyright is owned by the author(s), unless the author is an employee and the work is created 
within the course of employment, then the copyright is held by the employer. An independent 
contractor does not count as an employee unless stated otherwise.

Copyright may only be transferred in writing.

Copyright is implied.

### Infringement

Anyone who, without consent, does any of the five things that are exclusive right of the owner 
of the copyright has committed *primary infringement*.

Anyone who does this knowingly has committed *secondary infringement*.

Primary infringement is purely a civil matter, secondary infringement can be a criminal matter.

### Registering Copyright
In the EU, full copyright protection comes into affect when the work is 'fixed' (i.e. recorded in
some form).

In the USA protection is very limited until the copyright has been registered with the US Congress
Office.

### What counts as a copy?
Copyright is breached by copying 'the whole or a substantial part of the work', substantial 
doesn't necessarily mean a large part, just a key part.

Non-literal copying (e.g. using the same design to produce a similar system in a different 
language) also counts as breaching copyright.


### Licensing
A license allows someone (the *licensee*) to use a work for some or all purposes but the owner 
retains ownership. These licenses can be *exclusive* or *non-exclusive*, for a fixed period or be
*in perpetuity*.

In an assignment, the copyright owner transfers some or all rights of ownership to someone else 
(the *assignee*).

### What is allowed?
* Fair dealing, copying for:
    * Private study or research.
    * Criticism or review.
    * Reporting current events.
* Marking a back-up copy.
* Selling on.
* Decompilation for interoperability.
* Error correction.

### Enforcing Copyright
* Search and seizure.
* Injunction.
* Damages.
* Claim for profits.

Powerful copyright owners often prevent legal publication of copies by threatening action the 
publisher cannot afford to defend.


Patents
-------

Patents give an inventor the exclusive right to use or exploit their invention (or sell it) for 
up to 20 years.

The invention must be:

* New;
* Novel (involve an inventive step);
* Capable of industrial application;
* Not specifically excluded.

All patents are published and are publicly available.

### Specific Exclusions
* Scientific Theories;
* Mathematical Theories;
* Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;
* Presentation or information;
* Schemes, rules, or methods for performing a mental act, playing a game or doing business; or a 
program for a computer.

### Patent Owners
Patents are only granted to inventors or subsequent assignees.

Employees are treated as inventors unless the invention is made in the course of their normal 
duties, in which case the inventor is the company (special rules for senior management).

### Getting a Patent
It is essential to establish a *priority* when applying for a patent. There is a need to apply 
early, even if the invention isn't perfect.

### Software Patents
European Patent Convention states that software isn't patentable.

Software is patentable in the USA and have been enforced in sensible situations.


Confidential Information
------------------------

Information cannot be 'stolen', information can be prevented from being disclosed or used provided
an *obligation of confidence* exists, this comes through a contract or through equity (fairness or
common law).

In some cases, public interest can override the obligation of confidence.


Trademark Protection
--------------------

Includes trademarks (logos, etc.), trade names or "get-up" (a uniform or similar).

There are international agreements between most companies which oblige them to enact domestic laws
that fulfil the requirements of the agreement.

A trademark must be registered in each company in which protection is desired.

It is a criminal offence to use an unauthorised copyright commercially.


Domain Names
------------

Originally meant as a simple way of connection over the internet but is now regarded as a 
marketing term. Domain names are assigned by ICANN.

Domain names can conflict with trademarks.
Legislation
===========



Criminal Law
------------
Represents society's view of what is acceptable behaviour and what is not. The police (and some 
other agencies) are responsible for apprehending those who break criminal law.

Society brings then before a court and punishment takes the form of imprisonment, a fine, 
community service, etc.


Civil Law
---------
Regulates the relationship between people. Action is initiated by the aggrieved party (the 
*claimant*, formerly - and still in the USA - the *plaintiff*).


Standards of Proof
------------------
To convict someone of criminal offence, the prosecution must prove *beyond reasonable doubt* that
the defendant is guilty.

To obtain a judgement in a civil court, it is only necessary to establish the facts *on the 
balance of probabilities*.


Natural persons and legal persons
---------------------------------
Civil law is concerned with relationships between people. Therefore, unless a company is 
incorporated (a legal person) civil law is not applicable to a company.


Common Law
----------
Common law works by precedent (based on previous judgements). The judge may decide that a previous
judgement is no longer applicable. All countries are considered in common law.


Case Law
--------
Not all law may be clear so case law is the judges interpretation of a law.


Secondary Legislation
---------------------

An act of parliament often given the government power to introduce regulations (*statutory 
instruments*) that are laid before Parliament but are debated only if a member specifically calls 
for a debate.

###Examples:

* Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997
* Companies (Single Person Private Limited Companies) Regulations 1992
* Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981


European Union Law
------------------

The EU issues directives, approved by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. Member states are then required to enact legislation to give effect to these directives.

The European Count of Justice handles cases where the interpretation or implementation of directives is in question.

Data protection act was an EU act.


Legal Systems in Other Countries
--------------------------------

Distinction between civil and criminal law is universal. Common law largely restricted to countries that have been ruled by Britain. European countries other than the UK have a system based on Roman law.

Most large countries have bicameral legislatures, small ones usually have unicameral ones.

In some countries the second chamber has a revising function only while in others (e.g. the USA) it can also initiate legislation.

Federal states duplicate the legislative structure at the level of the individual state. There is often tension between state law and federal law.


Constitutions
-------------


Most countries (not the UK) have constitutions:

* How the country is governed
* The rights of the citizens
* ???

In countries with a written constitution there is a Supreme count which can strike out a legislation that is contrary to the constitution.

In the UK, the doctrine of the *sovereignty of Parliament*, means that if Parliament passes legislation, the courts cannot block it.


The IT profession
=================

A profession is organised into one or more professional bodies, substantial education and experience are necessary to practise the profession.

The professional bodies themselves decide the nature of this education and experience, and, more generally, control entry to the profession.

The professional body lays down standards of conduct and good practise and polices them (the profession may have a monopoly over certain titles and/or activities).


IT Professional Bodies
----------------------

* BCS (**not** the British Computing Society any more).
* Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)
* IMIS
* Association of Computing Professionals

* Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
* Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) - has within it the IEEE Computer Society.


The BCS
-------

Code of Conduct and its enforcement:

> You shall
> 
> * Only undertake to do work or provide a service that is within your professional competence
> * NOT misrepresent or withhold information on the performance of products, systems or services [...] or<small>[sic]</small> take advantage of the lack of relevant knowledge or inexperience of others.
> * etc.

Education:

* Professional Examinations
* Accreditation of courses

Advancement of knowledge

* Specialist groups
* *Computer Journal*
* Conferences

Continues the professional development.

Maintenance of professional standards of practice.

Give advice to parliament and government.


Reservation of Title
--------------------

Certain title can only be used by members of certain bodies or, in some cases, by registered professionals.


Reservation of functional
-------------------------

Certain tasks can only be undertaken by members of certain bodies or, in some cases, by registered professionals.
Human Resource Management
=========================

A.K.A. Common Sense.

Aims of HRM
-----------

To ensure that the organisation always has available the appropriately skilled, qualified and 
experienced staff that it needs in order to exploit its other assets, subject to

* the law;
* financial resources;
* company policy.
