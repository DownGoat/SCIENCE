# Autonomous Robot Localisation, Path Planning Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance
----

## Autonomous Operation

* Ideally issue a high level command - "go to the top of that hill"

## Required Funcionality for Navigation

* Cameras - less power demanding than systems like LIDAR
* Stereo PanCam - Cool filters 'hyperspectral'
* Navigation Cameras and Hazard Cameras - usually lower resolution and often
  monochrome
