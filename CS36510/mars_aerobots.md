#Challenges faced by Mars Aerobots

Some notes on the challenges faced by Martian Aerobots in contrast to Dave
Barnes' notes on [Challenges faced by titan aerobots](http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS36510/Titan%20Aerobot%20Notes.pdf).

In no particular order:

## Entry Descent and Deployment (EDD)

More is known about the surface of Mars than the surface of Titan in general.
There are quite a lot of suitable landing spots in the Northern hemisphere of
the planet, although the southern hemisphere is cratered and more dangerous to
land on. Deployment after landing is potentially a better option than
deployment during descent. Mars has a significantly thinner atmosphere than
Earth (less than 1% relatively speaking) and gravity is approximately 1/3rd of
the strength of Earthern gravity on the planet. Lower gravity means less lift
is required to get a balloon airbourne but a less dense atmosphere means a
larger envelope is required.

## Localisation

Localisation of a Martian aerobot presents significantly less of a challenge
than on titan. There are several comprehensive maps of the martian surface
since the atmosphere is a lot easier to penetrate. Therefore, terrain-based
localisation is an option. The problem of Martian localisation has already been
solved very effectively using NASA'S MER Localisation solution for rovers. A
variation on this technique could be build models of rock formations from above
the surface of the planet and use images of the terrain below to determine
where the aerobot currently is.

## Navigation

Navigation for a martian aerobot should be quite straight forward in terms of
current location and target location. However, propulsion technology would be
significantly more challenging to set up.
