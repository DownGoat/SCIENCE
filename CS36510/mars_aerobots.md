#Challenges faced by Mars Aerobots

Some notes on the challenges faced by Martian Aerobots in contrast to Dave
Barnes' notes on [Challenges faced by titan aerobots](http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/CourseNotes/current/CS36510/Titan%20Aerobot%20Notes.pdf).

In no particular order:
* *Entry Descent and Deployment (EDD)* - more is known about the surface of Mars
  than the surface of Titan in general. There are quite a lot of suitable
  landing spots in the Northern hemisphere of the planet, although the southern
  hemisphere is cratered and more dangerous to land on. Deployment after
  landing is potentially a better option than deployment during descent. Mars
  has a significantly thinner atmosphere than Earth (less than 1% relatively
  speaking) and gravity is approximately 1/3rd of the strength of Earthern
  gravity on the planet. Lower gravity means less lift is required to get a
  balloon airbourne but a less dense atmosphere means a larger envelope is
  required.
* *Localisation* of a Martian aerobot presents significantly less of a
  challenge than on titan. There are several comprehensive maps of the martian
  surface since the atmosphere is a lot easier to penetrate. Therefore,
  terrain-based localisation is an option. There is also the option of
  sun-based localisation
* Navigation
* Communication
* Longevity and survivability
