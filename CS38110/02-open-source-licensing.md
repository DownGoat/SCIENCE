Free and Open Source Licensing
==============================

Proprietary Licenses
--------------------

* Unlikely to differentiate between source code and binary forms
* Unlikely to distinguish between original and derivative works with the exception of disallowing them.
* May contain open source elements (under permissive licenses). Own code is not open source (contained to those modules).
* Licensed, not sold, to the customer. This is pretty similar to open source and free licenses. However the only rights granted are those specifically defined in the license.
* Only licenses software rights other than those owned by the licensor (i.e. not in open source code included). This is unlikely to be needed, but is used to counter any IP claims on the Open Source. However due to it being closed-source there should be no way of proving this without breaking the license agreement.
* Strict limitations on the use of the software:
    * No distribution
    * Only one copy installed on one machine, this includes network usage.
    * Typically allowed one extra copy for backup purposes.
* Implicit statement barring derivative works.
* Disclaimer of liability: not designed for high-risk applications
* Bars any transfer or sale of the software, except for the exception mandated by law which permits the user to sell the rights included as part of the original software, along with the physical medium regardless of the terms under which the work was originally licensed. TL;DR - No rights the licensee didn't already have.
* Automatic termination upon breach of the license.
* Limited warranty for the medium on which the software is distributed upon.
* Disclaim all responsibility for damages beyond the legal minimum. (Maximum claim of ~$50).
* Export regulations.
* Notices of included open source software and licenses.

Any breach of the above terminates the license and renders the user liable for further damages.

Known as a "Shrinkwrap" license.

Can do things like license access to the source code, but disallow re-distribution for 5 years.

Proprietary Licenses are typically assume asymmetric bargaining power - the buyer is essential left with a take-it-or-leave-it position. Sometimes, more powerful negotiating positions can get extra benefits.


Sun Community Source License
----------------------------

A special type of license which are similar to open source licenses, but which do not conform to the Open Source definitions. These licenses tend to have extra clauses which offer some protection to the licensor (in this case Sun/Oracle) but are still designed to benefit from a bazaar-style development model. In the case of the SCSL users are free to modify the source code, but cannot distribute without compliance compatibility provided by the licensor. This does limit the open source model severely, but is designed to protect the cross-compatibility of Java.

* Community Code, Community member -> Strong focus on community over "you".
* Less free flowing than open source/free licenses to enforce testing, etc.
* "Official Version".
* Lots of BS about reference code and other stuff.
