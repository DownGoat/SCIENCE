# Manipulation and grippers

* Quick overview of robot manipulators and stuff
* May be fixed on a set base or on top of a mobile platform.
* Max DOF is 6 - 3 from arm and 3 from wrist
* DOM - degrees of motion - how many joints are in the arm all together.
     * Equates to number of links
* Types of joins:
    * Prismatic joint
    * Revolute joint
    
* Arm classifications:
    * cartesian - like the crane games in arcade
    * cylindrical - goes around a central spinny thing.
    * spherical 
    * articulated
   
* Grippers:
    * Electromagnetic - can pick up the wrong thing
    * End of arm tooling - anything goes provided you can power it
    * Robot hands - clunky and hard to control
