CS26410 get it easy and are assessed on practicals :(


Commitment
----------

* 16 Lectures
* 6 hours of practicals after Easter
* Background reading


Robot Definitions
-----------------

> N. "A machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer."

Not the best definition as a washing machine could potentially be defined to be a robot.

A better description of the discipline is one which includes

* Design, manufacture, control and programming of robots
* Use to solve problems.
* Study of control processes, sensors and algorithms used in humans, animals and machines.
* The application of these control processes and algorithms to the design of robots.

Specific organisms have evolved to interact with the environment. So now a lot of research is done to build robots to imitate these simple organisms. We're starting to get to the point where you can do similar mechanical things.

Nature is a big inspiration for robotics

Essential part of robotics is the interaction with the environment. A robot should be able to perceive the world and affect the world around it.

From "Rabota" the Czech meaning for menial labour/work. Term "robot" coined in K. Chapek's play "Rossum's Universal Robots" (1920).

Robotics first used by Issac Asimov in his novels. Also brought up the ethics of robots:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human to be harmed.
2. A robot must obey orders from a human, except where it conflicts with the first law.
3. A robot must protect it's own existence, except where it conflicts with the first or second law.


What do we want out of a robot?
-------------------------------

Do we want one single robot to do many tasks or lots to do singular ones?

We already have things like Roomba and Asimov. Space robots are particularly popular.

Working on more and more complex robots.

Abstracted biological principals - stealing ideas from nature.

Something will always go wrong with robots.

Swarm robotics quire interesting.


Why would we use a robot?
-------------------------

Where humans would be at significant risk (space exploration, nuclear deactivation, etc.)

Economically better to have a robot where menial and repetitive tasks need a high level of accuracy.

Humanitarian use where there is a great risk (search and rescue in danger areas).

Bottom-up approach tends towards better performance (implement the simplest organism first, then work upwards. Natural selection, different levels of behaviour which can communicate).
