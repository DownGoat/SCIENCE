Ruby on Rails
=============

Ruby
----
Ruby is a dynamically typed, pure object-orientated language. It's also something that most people
on SE31520 won't have used before.

It's dynamically typed nature means that test suites are a must.


Why Rails?
----------
Java EE is a steep learning curve, whilst Rails provides a fairly simple way of quickly building
internet-based applications.

Rails is CRUD-style:
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

Later on in the course (particulary for RESTful web services) the reason this is important will 
become apparent and how these to align nicely with each other.

Rails is also nice as it fall within the 80% of the 80:20 rule; 80% of the time something like 
Rails if perfectly suitable for purpose. Only 20% of the time do you need something truely 
heavyweight like Java EE.

Rails has a very good development community, as does Ruby. This means there are a lot of resources
out there one can use for reference.

Rails also has a lot of resusable components available (Gems, plug-ins, etc.).

Rails Design Philospohy
-----------------------
Rails follow the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy. You should define things once and once 
only.

It also follows convention over configuration, therefore providing sensible defaults and code 
generation to follow the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.
