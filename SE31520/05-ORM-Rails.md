Object Relation Mapping and Rails
=================================

ActiveRecord
------------

Class is the table, an object is a row and an attribute is a column.


Why ORM?
--------

ORM Focues on business code over SQL, reduces the need for special data access object classes. It
also means different methods of persistance can be supported.

ORM framework can be more robuse and efficient than pure SQL (depending on the framework) and 
allows for more reusable code. However they can be unweildly.
