The Vienna Development Method
=============================

Early 1960's, IBM Vienna Laboratory, working on the formal definition PL/1 (in cooperation with IBM UK Labs. Hursley).

Metalanguage then known as VDL (Vienna Definition Language).

1974, Formal description of PL/1, notation used became known as *META-VI*.

Key developers:

* Dines Bj√∏rner
* Cliff D Jones

The notation evolved with time, essential an "English School" and a "Danish School".

Later developments:

* STC VDM Reference Language
* Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering (RAISE) Specification Language (RSL)

Then standardised into:

* BSI VDM Specification Language (VSL)
* International Standards ISO/IEC 13817-1, December 1996: "Vienna Development Methods - Specification Language - Part I: Base Language"


VDM as a Development Method
---------------------------

Start with a (very) abstract specification and build an implementation from it.

Uses *data reification* and *program decomposition*, both of which are accompanied by *proof obligations*

Specification defines Abstract data types...
